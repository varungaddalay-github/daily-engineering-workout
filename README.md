A daily practice repository for DSA, Data Engineering, System Design, SQL, and Terraform.

The goal is to build a strong, multi-disciplinary skill set that includes:

- Data Structures & Algorithms (Python)

- Large-Scale Data Engineering

- Distributed System Design

- Cloud Infrastructure (Terraform)

- BigTech-style performance & scalability thinking


This repo trains multi-disciplinary engineering instincts:

- How does this scale?

- What breaks under load?

- What’s the memory footprint?

- What’s the production equivalent of this algorithm?
